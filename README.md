AI Behaviour System Demo
	A plugin that will enable easy dynamic ai behaviour creation. It’s to help make the gaming worlds in rpg games feel more alive and realistic while allowing for more replayability by applying modifiers based off the Myer Briggs Personalities. This will make ai’s behave and do actions differently based on their personality loaded. Take for example a boar in a game, most of the time games will have them all behave the same way, but with this it would be possible to make so they have different reactions to the same triggers based on a modifiable factor.
