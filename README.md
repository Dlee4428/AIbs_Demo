# Background
	There is yet to be a plugin specifically for making AI behaviours dynamic that revolve around the concept of having AI agents having “personalities.” Most RPG games the enemies have a set pattern which can get easy to predict over time leaving little to no replayability when fighting the same enemies over and over again. 
We’ll be improving on how NPC behave in most games, by adding a plugin that could integrate with a generic AI and just by having multiple instances of said NPC, each instance would behave differently from the one before. 
Examples of dynamic behaviours that are similar to what we're trying to accomplish are the “Sims” games; and “Shadow of War : Lord of The Rings” nemesis system.

	If we have enough time, we could potentially make this a modular plugin allowing for other features to be added on to this, and potentially leaving this open for a modding community to improve.

AI Behaviour System Demo
	A plugin that will enable easy dynamic ai behaviour creation. It’s to help make the gaming worlds in rpg games feel more alive and realistic while allowing for more replayability by applying modifiers based off the Myer Briggs Personalities. This will make ai’s behave and do actions differently based on their personality loaded. Take for example a boar in a game, most of the time games will have them all behave the same way, but with this it would be possible to make so they have different reactions to the same triggers based on a modifiable factor.
